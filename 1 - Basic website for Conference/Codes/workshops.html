            <div class="title"> <h3>The 17th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation</h3> </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>SemEval is a series of international natural language processing (NLP) research workshops whose mission is to advance the current state of the art in semantic analysis and to help create high-quality annotated datasets in a range of increasingly challenging problems in natural language semantics. Each year's workshop features a collection of shared tasks in which computational semantic analysis systems designed by different teams are presented and compared.</p>

            <div class="title"> <h3>The 22nd Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing and Shared Tasks</h3> </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>The BioNLP workshop associated with the ACL SIGBIOMED special interest group has established itself as the primary venue for presenting foundational research in language processing for the biological and medical domains. The workshop is running every year since 2002 and continues getting stronger. BioNLP welcomes and encourages work on languages other than English, and inclusion and diversity. BioNLP truly encompasses the breadth of the domain and brings together researchers in bio- and clinical NLP from all over the world. The workshop will continue presenting work on a broad and interesting range of topics in NLP. The interest to biomedical language has broadened significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to grow: as access to information becomes easier and more people generate and access health-related text, it becomes clearer that only language technologies can enable and support adequate use of the biomedical text.</p>
                <p>BioNLP 2023 will be particularly interested in language processing that supports DEIA (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility). The work on detection and mitigation of bias and misinformation continues to be of interest. Research in languages other than English, particularly, under-represented languages, and health disparities are always of interest to BioNLP.</p>

            <div class="title"> <h3>The 4th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Discourse</h3> </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>The last ten years have seen a dramatic improvement in the ability of NLP systems to understand and produce words and sentences. This development has created a renewed interest in discourse phenomena as researchers move towards the processing of long-form text and conversations. There is a surge of activity in discourse parsing, coherence models, text summarization, corpora for discourse level reading comprehension, and discourse related/aided representation learning, to name a few, but the problems in computational approaches to discourse are still substantial. At this juncture, we have organized three Workshops on Computational Approaches to Discourse (CODI) at EMNLP 2020, EMNLP 2021 and COLING 2022 to bring together discourse experts and upcoming researchers. These workshops have catalyzed work to improve the speed and knowledge needed to solve such problems and have served as a forum for the discussion of suitable datasets and reliable evaluation methods.</p>
                <p>The 4th CODI workshop is planned as a 2 day event which brings together different subcommunities. It will feature invited talks and regular papers on the first day. The second day will be dedicated to shared tasks and special sessions which focus on the issues mentioned above. After a first successful iteration in 2019 and 2021 the shared task on Discourse Relation Parsing and Treebanking (DISRPT) will be held again in 2023, with three tasks: discourse segmentation, discourse connective identification and discourse relation classification, including new datasets and languages.</p>
